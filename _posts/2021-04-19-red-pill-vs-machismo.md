Is there a difference between Red Pill and Machismo? well today you gon lurn. as mentioned in this episode, here are two of the thesis I mentioned.

[Machismo](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/113654/moralese_1.pdf) research paper by Erik Morales

[A Theory for the Development of Machismo](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED268399.pdf) by Bron B. Ingoldsby

Now I know I that this episode could have been done better, and I shall.
