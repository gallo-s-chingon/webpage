This week I talk about rejection and how to deal with it. This is a far more common problem for males, but here in the past few years women have begun to "shoot their shot" sometimes with disastrous results. And while being angry, sad or feeling hurt is completely natural, how those feelings manifest themselves are often "not cool"

So this episode talks about how to deal with those feelings, move on and have a better chance next time you shot your shot.
