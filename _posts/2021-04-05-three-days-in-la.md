Three Days in LA

I was in LA and managed to get together with a friend that has worked on popular shows like Rick & Morty and now with the ShadowMachine (the production company behind BoJack Horseman).
But this isn't about those shows, there's a controversial question but only because others ask this to weaponize against the person (read males) being asked. In any who, I'll stop rambling here and just let you listen in.
