Squid, or how I can be friends with someone from another military branch and random conversations

So this episode was recorded from a livestream, as they usually are. But this week I have a special guest, or just guest however you wish to look at it. He's a friend and former co-worker who brought along another friend.
We'd talked about recording a Podcast together a few weeks before he moved away and now that he was visiting town we got our act together and stood around chatting for the world to see (but apparently not hear as there was an audio out issue during the livestream)
