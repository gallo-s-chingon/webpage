This episode I have a conversation with a kinkster, who wishes to remain anonymous and goes by Lola. Hopefully the voice morph I used allows for an intelligible episode. The topic is middles, though it's less common or well known it blurs the line with littles. Differentiating mostly with preferred activities.Â 

Join me on this episode to learn more about littles/middles and why I like the dynamic
