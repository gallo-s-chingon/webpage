Today I have yet ANOTHER conversation with Boogie one half of the hosting duo from [Blokk Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/2K8ewIGz4Cp544OqMycRoM?si=4c73342748fe4b61). The IG is [Cementblock_Productions](https://www.instagram.com/cementblock_productions/) and we started the conversation about our simpin stories, but ended up talking about a slew of things. The value of pussy, Paternity, Men's rights and the rest you'll just have to listen to find out more
