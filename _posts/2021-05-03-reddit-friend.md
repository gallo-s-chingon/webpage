Today I talk with my friend in Japan (Nippon) for the first time over Video! Nothing to crazy, just chatting about how we met and why I remain friends with him.
You can find him on Instagram @kairu2019, you might get lucky and get a digital self-portrait like me! I would highly recommend you reach out to him for a commission, he does great fountain pen sketches.
