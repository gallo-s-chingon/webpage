My ♥️ and Frustration with Roller Derby

Today I talk about my love and frustration with roller derby and how it could fix itself… if they can get their head out of their ass.
By they I mean the Governing body of Roller Derby [WFTDA](https://wftda.com) as well as the derby teams and in most cases the players… I guess it kinda does sound like I have something against Roller Derby. But trust me, it is something that I love and care for deeply.
