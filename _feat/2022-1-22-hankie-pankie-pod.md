This week Coralyn interviews Gallo Chingon. Gallo is a recovering  sex-addict and  shares his story with our listeners and it is quite the  eye-opener.   Gallo is of Texas Mexican heritage. His life story is very  diverse and interesting in that he's lived through quite a few  tragedies and near tragedies, made his way out of homelessness, served  in the US army, and  although not involved in the adult industry his  story shares a different side.    

As a recovering sex addict,  having sex with over 1000 women he shares  with our listeners when it dawned on him that he actually was addicted  to sex and if he was not having sex at least 4 times a day he felt  inadequate.
