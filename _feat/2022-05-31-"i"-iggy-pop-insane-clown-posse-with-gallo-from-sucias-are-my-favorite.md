It's interesting indeed, inferring ideas from our I artists!


Joining me this go 'round, a very special (unique) episode #50 (!) for File Under: Entertainment, is Gallo, from Sucias Are My Favorite, where his episodes focus typically about general conversations about dating, relationships, the kink community, and other adult topics. Plus some basics about kink you ought to know, what it is, what it isn't.


First, CONSENT – Believe it or not, K!nk (should not) happen without it.

TRUST – you have to trust each other.

SAFETY – you have to trust that your partner will be safe.

These three together are the foundation of K!nk and with it one can safely explore their own boundaries with someone else.


The topics don't end there, though. He's got episodes discussing his time in the military (Army, but we'll allow, lol), also, as a Roller Derby ref, machismo and 'the red pill', and other interesting topics.


Gallo is intelligent, well-spoken, and informed. Check out his show.


Also making a vocal appearance (twice now!), to shed more light on WHY ICP isn't the most awful band in the land, is Super Producer Jared, from 'Feathers And Friends' and 'Parrot Gaming Productions'.


That's right, we get some out of character offerings from Iggy Pop; and.....about what you'd probably expect, I guess, from Insane Clown Posse.


The songs discussed, in order, are:


Iggy Pop - Lust For Life


Iggy Pop - Isolation


Iggy Pop - Talking Snake


Iggy Pop - Avenue B


Iggy Pop - American Valhalla


Insane Clown Posse - Bitches


Insane Clown Posse - Let's Go All The Way


Insane Clown Posse - Please Don't Hate Me


Insane Clown Posse - Just Like That


Insane Clown Posse - Piggy Pie





TRIGGER WARNING: Insane Clown Posse talk consistently about violence, in general, but especially against women in the opening track, and there is also discussion about suicide / self harm in the final track, which leads to a discussion between Gallo and myself pretty extensively about the topic, as well as gun violence and also politics in general.





Naturally, we also play "Is It Aerosmith", now with its own thematic introduction!


If you, or a loved one, is, or has been affected by sexual violence, please know that there are good people and organizations in the world that can offer help.


RAINN is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.


NSVRC (national sexual violence research center) has resources to help victims, and, importantly, tips on prevention and warning signs.


If you have the means to donate, please do so. Every little bit helps.
