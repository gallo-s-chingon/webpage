Episode Description

Gallo and I start off talking about if he would sleep with his manager if she were a girl and we quickly get to talking about Gallo's past struggles with sex addiction 00:01:00.  He stopped counting the women he's slept with at 1000.  We also spoke about the tragic passing of Gallo's ex wife and his self described soul mate 00:33:30.  Gallo and I then go into the subject of mental health 00:58:18 where Gallo and I both have some rare opinions that I found funny and insightful.
