# When I didn't like using terminal

Well to be honest, I was not originally a fan of terminal. I wasn't afraid of it so to speak, I just did no think I had any use for it. But I stumbled onto Plex around 2005. At the time, Netflix only "rented" DVDs via mail. So I would rip copies of DVDs/Blu Rays using Handbrake. Storing them to be viewed via Plex. However to use Plex back then, you basically needed an HTPC or simply watch on your computer that held the files you would watch. It wasn't until apple TV 3 that one could jailbreak and add Plex app to be able to use Plex to watch TV/Movies. But to do so, one would have to "tinker" with things. 

# How I started to change my mind

A few years later I met a guy that was IT for the Houston Chronicle. Very nerdy guy, which is probably what put me off paying attention to him. But one thing stood out when I was hanging out with him. Several concussions later, I distinctly remember him saying, "I can move around the file system faster than you can in the GUI" at the time I thought *this guy is nuts* but kept quiet and snarkily said something to the effect of "yeah? what about making a bunch of folders". I don't recall the scenario, but messing with Plex back then, it wasn't as robust and good at reading file names to play the files in the correct order. So one would HAVE to make a folder structure like
```
Show Name/
  Season 1/
    Show.Name.S01E01.episodeName.mp4
    Show.Name.S01E02.episodeName.mkv
```
So I asked about making that folder structure fast. He said, yeah, that's easy. did some typing voodo and ran `ls --tree` and showed about 25 folders made in the amount of time it took to write out all the names. 


# Why I like using terminal

Since then, I've learned a thing or two. I'm not a hacker, by any means. But I can work in the terminal and make it look like I am one.
