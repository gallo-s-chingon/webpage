### hard work is hard

The last few months I'd been having issues with my old web domain. Not so much the domain, but the display of what I posted/wrote. I didn't take the time to fully understand what went into the webpage I made. Even though it's quite simple (compared to something like cnn.com) there are ***a lot*** of *'moving parts'*

However, I didn't pay attention to what I was doing and hacked together a solution that "worked" for now. But I can never leave *well enough alone* I also wanted to have a blog (that is **mine**) not one held hostage by a platform. I wanted to sort my guest spots on their own page and have a contact page a little harder to find (to avoid spam)
